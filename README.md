# individual-project
Individual project for the basic programming course. The course is ongoing at the time of writing.
The project imports and renders posts from dmmyJSON and allows new posts to be added.
It is currently a pass (G), and more functionality (saving to local storage and adding likes) will be 
added before the end of the course (end 2023) in order to make it a VG.
16/11/2023: now added VG features, will later sort out the order in which posts are rendered.
