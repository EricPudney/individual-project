# individual-project
Individual project for the basic programming course. 
The project imports and renders posts from dmmyJSON and allows new posts to be added. Posts are then
saved to local storage. Posts can be liked and are sorted according to likes on refreshing. 
I have also added a filter function so that posts can be filtered according to tags, and a delete button to remove posts.
