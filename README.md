# individual-project
Individual project for the basic programming course. 
The project imports and renders fake social media posts from dummyJSON/local storage and allows new posts to be added. Posts are then
saved to local storage. Posts can be liked and are sorted according to likes on refresh. 
I have also added a filter function so that posts can be filtered according to tags, and a delete button to remove posts.
